# 3d printable neural network puzzle

A water based 3d printable neural network puzzle.

## A lego like experience

The idea behind this project is to creat a few lego like components from which a simple neural networks can be created. A tactile and visual way of building a neural network may provide a deeper understanding of what machine learning is and how a machine learnedm model may look like.

The components in it's current form can be used to demonstrate how neurons can classify A few more iteration of the components would be needed for a lego like experience, but 


## The neural components
